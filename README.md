# Nokia Snake Game 🐍

Relive the nostalgia of the iconic Nokia Snake Game, reimagined with modern software design principles in Kotlin.

Welcome to NokiaSnakeGame, a faithful recreation of the classic Snake game that defined mobile gaming on early Nokia devices. Built with Kotlin, this project showcases clean architecture, adherence to SOLID principles (specifically Dependency Inversion Principle), and efficient data structures like LinkedList for optimal performance. Whether you're a gamer, a fellow developer, or just curious, dive in to explore, play, or contribute to this timeless piece of gaming history.
## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Platform**: Console Game
- **Design Principle**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) for UI abstraction and flexibility
- **Data Structure**: LinkedList for dynamic and efficient management of the snake's body
- **Tools**: Git for version control, Gradle for build automation
